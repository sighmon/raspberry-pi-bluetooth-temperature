## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Oregon Scientific IDTW211R weather station

## Software

A Raspberry Pi Zero W with Raspbian Stretch has all of the tools to scan for your weather station. To find it's BLE address:

`$ sudo hcitool lescan`

You should be able to see it in the list, something like:

`<BLE ADDRESS> IDTW211R`

### Retrieve temperature data from the command line

Now that we know the address, we can connect to it:

```bash
$ sudo gatttool -b <BLE ADDRESS> -t random -I
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> connect
Attempting to connect to <BLE ADDRESS>
Connection successful
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> primary
attr handle: 0x0001, end grp handle: 0x0007 uuid: 00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
attr handle: 0x0008, end grp handle: 0x0008 uuid: 00001801-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
attr handle: 0x0009, end grp handle: 0x0021 uuid: 74e7fe00-c6a4-11e2-b7a9-0002a5d5c51b
attr handle: 0x0022, end grp handle: 0x002e uuid: 0000180a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
attr handle: 0x002f, end grp handle: 0xffff uuid: 0000180f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
```

To receive data from it, we enable indication by writting 0x0002 (0x0001 for notification) in Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (UUID: 0x2902) of each characteristic. Write shall be placed in little endian format so:

```bash
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x000c 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x000f 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x0012 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x0015 0100
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x0018 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x001b 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x001e 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x0021 0200
Characteristic value was written successfully
[<BLE ADDRESS>][LE]> char-write-req 0x0032 0100
Characteristic value was written successfully

```

In return, you should start getting indications/notifications. The relevant ones for us are `INDOOR_AND_CH1_TO_3_TH_DATA` indications (so handle 0x0017).

For each round of indications, we get two data packets of 20 bytes each. The most significant byte indicates the type of data (Type 0 or Type 1). See below for more details on the data packets.

You can also retrieve the battery level:

```bash
$ sudo gatttool -b <BLE ADDRESS> -t random --char-read --handle=0x0031

or

$ sudo gatttool -b <BLE ADDRESS> -t random --char-read --uuid=0x2A19

```

Or use the `bluetoothctl` tool ([Adafruit video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fQR2PHMDWE&feature=youtu.be&t=4644)):

```bash
$ sudo bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# connect <BLE ADDRESS>
[IDTW211R]# select-attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_<BLE ADDRESS>/service002f/char0030
[IDTW211R:/service002f/char0030]# read
Attempting to read /org/bluez/hci0/dev_<BLE ADDRESS>/service002f/char0030
[CHG] Attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_<BLE ADDRESS>/service002f/char0030 Value: 0x64
```

### Retrieve temperature data via Python

First install [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy):

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip libglib2.0-dev
$ sudo pip install bluepy
```

Now run the python script handing in the address of your weather station:

```bash
$ python temperature.py <BLE ADDRESS>
```

If you'd rather get the script to scan for the weather station, you need to run it with root privileges:

```bash
$ sudo python temperature.py
```

You should see output:

```bash
$ python temperature.py <BLE ADDRESS>

### Run it hourly via a crontab

To set it up to run hourly, edit your crontab:

```bash
$ crontab -e
@hourly python /home/pi/temperature.py <BLE ADDRESS> >> /home/pi/cron-temperature.log
```

## Prometheus and Homekit

* Expose these readings via Prometheus: https://github.com/sighmon/oregon-temperature-prometheus
* Add the readings to Homekit: https://github.com/sighmon/homekit-oregon-temperature
